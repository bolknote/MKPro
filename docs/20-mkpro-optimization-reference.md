# MK-Pro Optimization and Lowering Strategy Reference

This is an implementation-level reference for the current translator in this repository. It describes what the compiler optimizes and lowers, where each optimization is applied, and how to read reported capabilities.

The translator runs on MK-Pro source and emits MK-61 program bytes. Optimizations are selected only when semantics are preserved under the selected MK-61 exact-machine profile. If an optimization is skipped, it is usually because the prerequisite constraints, control-flow shape, or machine feature preconditions were not met.

## 1) Compilation flow and optimization scope

The optimizer works in multiple passes, not in a single “on/off” mode.

1. Parse and normalize source.
2. Run source-level rewrites over MK-Pro AST.
3. Estimate intent, ranges, and live state usage.
4. Allocate registers and infer storage strategies.
5. Build display lowering strategy.
6. Perform lowering of high-level statements, reads, displays, dispatches, functions, and spatial helpers.
7. Run a set of IR-level optimization passes iteratively.
8. Run layout and apply layout-sensitive indirect/dark-entry candidates.
9. Optionally compile and optimize setup program (for initializers requiring work).
10. Select the best lowering variant by cell count under the 105-cell window.

For over-budget programs, compile retries include candidate demotions (constant demotion, helper-shape changes) that can free a selector register and enable stronger indirect flow lowering.

## 2) Sources of reported information

Use `mk-pro --out json` or `mk-pro explain` to inspect:

- `report.optimizations` — exact optimization names that fired.
- `report.optimizer` — capability matrix (`active`, `considered`, `planned`, `candidate`).

## 13) IR pass pipeline (fixed-point)

The IR pipeline defined in `src/core/passes/index.ts` runs repeatedly:

1. `redundant-prologue-elimination`
2. `tail-call`
3. `tail-branch-inversion`
4. `shared-call-tail`
5. `return-suffix-gadget`
6. `return-zero-jump`
7. `store-recall-peephole`
8. `jump-to-next-threading`
9. `jump-thread`
10. `stable-indirect-flow`
11. `preloaded-indirect-flow`
12. `indirect-memory-table`
13. `dead-store-before-commutative`
14. `dead-store-elimination`
15. `last-x-reuse`
16. `r0-fractional-sentinel`
17. `vp-splice`
18. `vp-x2-peephole`
19. `constant-folding`
20. `duplicate-failure-tail`
21. `cse-display-block`
22. `dead-code-after-halt`
23. `register-coalesce`
24. `arithmetic-if-pass`

A fixed-point loop repeats while transformations continue, up to internal iteration limits.

## 14) Setup-program and preload strategy

Setup generation is separate from main program layout when needed:

- `generated-setup-program` indicates that a setup routine was emitted.
- `preloaded-constant`, `preloaded-constant` and `constant-synthesis` entries describe synthetic constants.
- `auto-preload-initial-state` and `intent-state-lowering` can push selected state to setup only.
- `intent-read-lowering`, `show-read-*` may force setup when runtime behavior or literals require state initialization.
- Setup helpers are themselves subject to the same optimization pipeline (`setup-...` names appear as prefixed entries).

## 15) Machine features this optimizer may activate in report

Feature flags are added only after successful candidate/optimization evidence:

- `return-empty-stack-jump`
- `branch-removal`
- `indirect-flow`
- `indirect-memory`
- `dark-entries`
- `address-constants`
- `x2-register`
- `negative-zero-degree`
- `x2-restore-boundaries`
- `z-stack-register`
- `display-bytes`
- `r0-fractional-sentinel`
- `r0-t-alias`
- `error-stops`
- `code-data-overlay`
- `display-byte`

These are not independent optimizations; they gate whether the lowering strategy can legally use the corresponding opcode/behavior.

## 16) Proof-guided safety model (important)

The optimizer does not blindly apply undocumented behavior. Several proofs are explicitly logged and checked:

- `value-ranges`, `observability`, and `formal-address-operands` when source bounds are known.
- branch equivalence proof for `branch-removal` and arithmetic-if variants.
- `negative-zero-threshold-selector` proof for threshold selectors.
- `indirect-addressing-ranges` proof when selector stability is required.
- `super-dark-suffix-layout` proof when FA..FF dispatch is selected.
- `return-stack-empty` proof for `I/O` as `JP 01` behavior.

If proofs are insufficient, those transformations are not activated.

## 17) Practical tuning rules for game authors

1. Prefer stable finite ranges for counters and coordinates.
2. Keep branch conditions simple and deterministic.
3. Compose displays from a few reusable fields.
4. Reuse identifiers in temporary values; this helps current-X reuse.
5. Avoid unnecessary string temporaries; prefer direct `show(...)` fragments.
6. Keep helper-like repeated computations in one place to trigger CSE and helper lowering.
7. Use single-purpose states and avoid side-effecting function wrappers unless semantically necessary.

## 18) What to inspect first after a compile

1. `report.budgetReport` for fit and largest blocks.
2. `report.optimizer` to see which capabilities were `active` / `considered` / `planned`.
3. `report.optimizations` for concrete names.
4. `machineFeaturesUsed` to ensure edge tactics were only enabled where intended.
5. `proofs` to validate any risky-looking branchless and indirect behavior.

## 19) Non-goals and current limits

- The compiler does not expose every microcode trick as a source hint.
- Some capability entries remain `candidate`/`planned` while not yet stable enough for global enabling.
- Optimization priority is always bounded by semantic safety and layout validity, then by cell budget.

This reference should be used as a working map while reading generated listings in explain/json mode: every named optimization corresponds to a concrete rewrite class that can be correlated with local sequences in emitted IR or final machine text.
