# MK-Pro Optimization and Lowering Strategy Reference

This is an implementation-level reference for the current translator in this repository. It describes what the compiler optimizes and lowers, where each optimization is applied, and how to read reported capabilities.

The translator runs on MK-Pro source and emits MK-61 program bytes. Optimizations are selected only when semantics are preserved under the selected MK-61 exact-machine profile. If an optimization is skipped, it is usually because the prerequisite constraints, control-flow shape, or machine feature preconditions were not met.

## 1) Compilation flow and optimization scope

The optimizer works in multiple passes, not in a single “on/off” mode.

1. Parse and normalize source.
2. Run source-level rewrites over MK-Pro AST.
3. Estimate intent, ranges, and live state usage.
4. Allocate registers and infer storage strategies.
5. Build display lowering strategy.
6. Perform lowering of high-level statements, reads, displays, dispatches, functions, and spatial helpers.
7. Run a set of IR-level optimization passes iteratively.
8. Run layout and apply layout-sensitive indirect/dark-entry candidates.
9. Optionally compile and optimize setup program (for initializers requiring work).
10. Select the best lowering variant by cell count under the 105-cell window, using estimated startup+program cost as a tie-break for over-budget variants.

For over-budget programs, compile retries include candidate demotions (constant demotion, helper-shape changes) that can free a selector register and enable stronger indirect flow lowering.

Note:
- Internal compiler artifacts such as `#display-anchor`, `#display-literal-gap`, `neighbor_count`, and `line_count` are intentionally not listed as optimization IDs in this document.
- The method IDs listed in this reference are the ones emitted into `report.optimizations` / `report.optimizer`, while the values above are structural field/call labels used during lowering.

Capabilities can be `considered` and not active if no matching shape is found.

## 4) AST and source-level rewrites

These transformations run on source constructs before machine lowering:

- `constant-indexed-state-resolution` — if array/field index is known at compile time, substitutes the exact cell address directly.
- `affine-indexed-selector-reuse` — if an affine dynamic index such as `physical - 3` already evaluates to the physical register number for a contiguous bank member, uses that variable as the MK-61 indirect selector instead of allocating and filling a separate selector.
- `fractional-indirect-addressing` — if `bank[int(selector)]` targets a physically aligned contiguous bank and `selector` is already in `R7..Re`, uses that register directly as the indirect-memory selector. This relies on MK-61 indirect memory addressing ignoring the fractional tail, so packed coordinates can select by their integer part without an explicit `К [x]`.
- `indexed-selector-cache` — when repeated dynamic bank accesses share the same index expression, reuses the cached selector directly or derives a sibling field selector by applying only the contiguous offset delta.
- `display-string-inline` — moves text templates directly into `show`, removing separate temporary definitions.
- `display-string-guarded-show` — hoists guarded string value selection into the display path when safe.
- `display-string-assignment-elimination` — deletes compile-time removable display-string assignments that only flow into later `show` inputs and are never consumed elsewhere.
- `display-edge-whitespace-trim` — removes leading/trailing whitespace around templates that does not affect display output.
- `expression-constant-folder` — precomputes constant expression subtrees.
- `entered-current-x` — consumes the currently keyboard-entered X value for the `entered()` builtin without emitting a second stop, clearing tracked X aliases because the value is already live in X.
- `show-read-fusion` — merges `show(...)` with a following `read`-based assignment/input path into one calculator `С/П`: `show(...); x = read()` or `show(...); x = int(read())` / `frac(int(read()))` forms share the same input stop and avoid emitting a second `С/П`.
- `show-read-decrement-underflow-fusion` — merges `show -> input -> decrement -> if (counter < 0) ...` into one compact sequence, keeping input in `Y` across the decrement-underflow check.
- `show-read-stack-stop-risk-lowering` — a generalized "stack-stop fusion": when a single plain `show` source value (`stake`) is combined with a freshly read input across the stop, it keeps `stake` in `Y`, transforms the input in `X`, and computes the result directly on the stack with no input register. It recognizes any pure shape `wrap*( stake (op) g(input) )` where `op` is `+`/`-`/`*`/`/` (non-commutative ops keep `stake` on the left so they map to the machine's `Y op X` order), `g(input)` is a chain of single-argument X-transform intrinsics over the input (e.g. `sin`, `cos`, `tg`, `sqrt`) optionally fused with one single-digit additive/scaling constant, and `wrap*` is an outer chain of X-transform intrinsics (e.g. `int`, `frac`). The input leaf may be a direct `sin(read())` or a stored input field, avoiding a source-visible throwaway field. The classic `int(stake * (1 + sin(read())))` robber-fight idiom is the canonical case and lowers byte-for-byte identically; the generalization never grows a program because every accepted form reuses the same kept-in-`Y` stack sequence.
- `loop-carried-prompt-x` — for loops shaped as `show(screen); key = read()` where every non-terminal branch assigns the next `screen`, removes the register-backed prompt state and leaves the next visible value in `X` for the loop-back stop. If the prompt starts from `stack.X` / `stack.Y`, an allocated sibling field initialized from the same stack slot can seed the first prompt.
- `loop-carried-prompt-input-branch` — after a loop-carried prompt stop, branches directly on the read key with no extra store when the branch condition consumes only that input.
- `loop-carried-prompt-input-dispatch` — after a loop-carried prompt stop, dispatches directly on the read key with no intermediate variable, while preserving the prompt flow across loop back-edge.
- `loop-carried-prompt-decrement-underflow` — after a loop-carried prompt stop, handles `resource--; if resource < 0 ...` patterns by checking underflow in-line. It keeps the input value in `Y`, emits `F x<0` branch flow, and restores `X/Y` state only where required for the next prompt consumer.
- `show-read-guarded-transfer` — rewrites `show; x=input; decrementTarget -= x; if decrementTarget < 0 { halt } ; incrementTarget += x; if incrementTarget < 0 { halt }` into one stack-based sequence that keeps the read value on the stack across both guarded updates.
- `counted-loop-unroll` — replaces small constant-trip counted `while` loops with explicit per-iteration copies when the induction variable updates are simple linear steps and entry values are known constants; this removes the loop machinery and registers update logic.
- `counted-loop-unroll-free-scratch` — runs counted-loop unrolling together with residual-dispatch scratch freeing (`freeResidualDispatchScratch`) as one candidate.
- `state-init-counted-loop` — recovers the compact one-cell `F Lx` counted-loop lowering for countdown loops whose counter carries its initial value on the state field (`time: counter 0..N = N` + `while time >= 1 { …; time-- }`). When that counter is used solely by the loop in the top-level entry body, the state initializer is rewritten into an explicit `time = N` immediately before the loop, matching the already-supported explicit-init form byte-for-byte while staying re-runnable (the inline store re-arms the counter on every `С/П`, unlike a setup-only preload).
- `setup-only-counted-loop-init` — speculative companion to `state-init-counted-loop`: keeps the countdown initializer in the generated setup program and still emits the compact `F Lx` loop. This mirrors hand-entered MK listings whose loop counter is loaded before the main program starts; considered only in size-rescue compiles and selected only when the whole program shrinks.
- `initialized-counted-while-loop` — compiles `x = N; while x >= 1` / `> 0` loops with `x--` in the last body statement into compact `F Lx` loops when the pattern is safe (intervening statements do not touch `x`, loop body has non-terminating tail, and the loop register has an `F Lx` opcode).
- All three counted-loop init strategies above (`state-init-counted-loop`, `setup-only-counted-loop-init`, `initialized-counted-while-loop`) share one loop recognizer (`recognizeCountedWhileLoop` over `unitDecrementCountedWhileTarget`) and one emit tail (`emitCountedWhileBody`): they accept the same equivalent condition spellings (`x >= 1`, `x > 0`, `1 <= x`, `0 < x`) and differ only in how the counter's starting value is supplied (inline store, setup preload, or state-field initializer normalized to an inline store). `counted-loop-unroll` is a separate family that targets ascending `while v < bound` / `<= bound` loops, not the unit-decrement countdown.
- `domain-error-guard` — replaces a terminal-error guard (`if <expr> <op> 0 { halt("ЕГГОГ") }`, including a call to a proc whose body is just that trap) with a single self-trapping domain opcode that raises ЕГГОГ exactly on its mathematical domain (all proved on hardware in `tests/emulator/trap-opcodes.test.ts`): `F √` for `<` (traps iff X < 0), `F lg` for `<=` (iff X <= 0), and `F 1/x` for `==` (iff X == 0, division by zero — the exact equality trap regardless of sign). `>`/`>=` reduce to the swapped difference. The guard computes the comparison difference into X so the trap fires iff the condition holds; otherwise it falls through into the false branch. This collapses the compare + conditional branch + shared trap into one cell, and when every caller of a shared trap proc is converted the proc becomes dead and is dropped. Speculative (`domainErrorGuards`): adopted only when the whole program ends up smaller. Examples: rambo-iii 139→135, alaram 80→76, dungeon 85→83, wumpus 105→103.
- `indexed-assign-zero-domain-guard` — extends the adjacent store+trap fusion to dynamic indexed stores. After `cells[i] = expr`, `К X→П i` leaves the stored value in X, so an immediate `if cells[i] <op> 0 { halt("ЕГГОГ") }` can emit the self-trapping opcode directly without a redundant `К П→X i`. It now shares the same comparison→opcode table as the scalar guards (`planDomainErrorGuard`): `<`→`F √`, `<=`→`F lg`, and `==`→`F 1/x` (the equality trap the earlier bespoke indexed table could not express). All store-then-trap fusions (`domain-error-guard`, `assign-zero-domain-guard`, `indexed-assign-zero-domain-guard`, and the unit-decrement guards) emit their trap through one shared `emitDomainTrapOnX` tail.
- `assign-zero-fallback-store` — defers the register store for `x = expr; unless x { x = fallback }` until after the zero fallback. The branch tests the just-computed X value, emits the fallback only on the zero path, and performs one shared `X→П`.
- `prior-random-branch-stack-reuse` — for `old = random_state; random_state = random(); if old - random_state < 0 ...`, keeps the old random in Y while storing the new random, then branches on the subtraction without spilling `old`.
- `prior-random-fractional-decrement` — recognizes guarded fractional decrements of the form `old=random_state; random_state=random(); step=int((old+random_state+1)*factor*amount/divisor)/scale; if frac(amount)-step <= 0 trap else amount -= step`. It keeps `frac(amount)` and the old random on the stack, and reuses a just-stored amount in X when the source flow leaves one there.
- All three prior-random idioms (`prior-random-stack-reuse`, `prior-random-branch-stack-reuse`, `prior-random-fractional-decrement`) share one recognizer preamble (`matchPriorRandomSeedUpdate`) and one kept-in-Y head (`emitPriorRandomSeedUpdate`): they match `old = seed; seed = random()` — written inline or as a call to a one-statement random proc, which is inlined — and emit `recall seed; В↑; К СЧ; store seed` so the previous value stays parked in Y for the following stack-direct consumer. They differ only in how that consumer (a pure expression, a `<` branch, or a guarded fractional decrement) reads Y and the new X. `show-read-guarded-transfer` emits its negative-balance trap through the shared `emitDomainTrapOnX` tail (the same `F √` self-trap used by the store-then-domain-trap fusions).
- `decrement-zero-domain-guard` — when a unit decrement is followed by a terminal `x == 0` error guard and no compact `F Lx` counter opcode is available, stores the decremented value and uses `F 1/x` as the zero trap.
- `startup-aware-constant-preloads` — tries a variant that leaves setup-expensive synthesized constants inline, such as decimal powers built with `F 10^x`, when that lowers estimated startup+program cost without increasing the main program size.
- `intent-read-lowering` — inlines direct `read()`-driven arguments when they are used to initialize x-param stake/sin procs and related intent states.
- `intent-domain-lowering` — normalizes special intent types into a base form for later compilation.
- `packed-counter-stripes` — packs dense counters into a shorter representation.
- `x-param-state-elision` — removes redundant transition states when rule/function parameters are consumed directly from `X`.
- `tail-copy-assignment-fusion` — merges copy assignments in tail blocks into one write pass.
- `if-chain-dispatch-canonicalization` — turns long `if` / inverted `if !=` chains that test the same deterministic expression against constants into a single dispatch template.
- `constant-guarded-call-inline` — inlines a guarded call when used once and safe.
- `common-branch-tail-hoisting` — merges identical tails from similar branches.
- `single-use-tail-inline` — inlines a one-time tail instead of emitting a separate call.
- `expression-helper` — builds a shared helper for a pure, expensive expression when repeated use count makes it profitable after cost gating.
- `expression-helper-call` — replaces repeated inline compilation of the same pure expression with a helper call (`ПП`) when that helper already exists.
- `near-any-helper` — emits a shared helper for `near_any`-style checks that computes absolute deltas and compares against a precomputed radius.
- `repeated-x-param-self-assignment` — for consecutive `x = f(x)` / `x = f(x)` (or indexed equivalents) on the same target, emits two x-param calls in one X-based chain and stores once.
- `single-use-guard-substitution` — removes a one-shot assignment if it can be substituted directly into a following condition and the lowered cost is strictly lower.
- `compact-dispatch-simplification` — compresses small dispatches to a minimal jump tree.
- `one-shot-loop-init-hoist` — hoists loop initialization that runs once out of repeated body.
- `if-branch-order-inversion` — reorders condition branches so profitable paths are checked earlier.
- `guarded-prologue-gadget` — creates one guarded prologue for multiple branches where logic is equivalent.
- `dead-state-elimination` — removes state fields that do not affect outcomes.
- `identity-assignment-elimination` — removes useless assignments like `x = x`.
- `terminal-display-fusion` — merges final `show+HALT` into a shorter block.

  immediately consumes the same scalar (for example `halt(x)`/`pause(x)`).
- `equality-zero-fallthrough` — marks the true branch of a simple `a == b`
  comparison as having zero already in X, so `halt(0)`, `pause(0)`, and similar
  immediate zero consumers do not materialize a fresh zero.
- `inequality-zero-false-branch` — marks the false branch of a proved `expr != 0`

## 6) Function and call lowering

- `x-param-return-decay-call` — applies the same X-return pattern at call sites.
- `x-param-stack-stop-risk-read` — compiles a single-argument x-param helper proc shaped as `show(param); return wrap*( param (op) g(read()) )` so it consumes its argument from X and returns through direct `В/О`, reusing the same generalized stack-stop fusion prepared by `show-read-stack-stop-risk-lowering` (any X-transform intrinsic, binary op, single-digit constant, and outer wrap chain — not only `int(param * (1 + sin(read())))`).
- `x-param-stack-stop-risk-call` — compiles a one-argument call into the matched stake/sin helper procedure by passing its argument in X, based on a strict two-statement body shape (`show` of the argument source, then `return int(arg * (1 + sin(read())))` in equivalent forms).

- `function-tail-recursion` — recognizes tail recursion and turns it into a loop.
- `function-tail-call` — converts function tail recursion into a direct jump to entry, skipping the final call.

## 7) Indirect flow, dispatch, and addressing strategies

The translator aggressively evaluates when undocumented/edge MK-61 behavior can be relied on.

- `stable-indirect-flow` — after register-liveness analysis, routes branches/calls through one indirect pointer.
- `indirect-register-flow` — the same for regions where address is in a register and already safe for indirect jump.
- `preloaded-indirect-flow` — preloads selector/address once so multiple indirect jumps become shorter. The post-layout pass is not started for already in-budget programs, but if a program needed indirect-flow rescue it keeps applying all further proved shrinking rewrites instead of stopping at the first <=105 result.
- `runtime-indirect-call-flow` — for repeated backward helper calls with legal numeric targets, initializes a dead stable register once at runtime and replaces direct `ПП addr` pairs with one-cell `К ПП r` calls.
- `preloaded-super-dark-flow` — super-dark path with a preloaded indirect target.
- `indirect-incdec-counter` — lowers a unit `x++`/`x--` through the indirect pre-increment (R4..R6) or pre-decrement (R0..R3) side effect of `К П->X r`, a one-cell true `±1` that correctly reaches 0 (used as the standalone unit-decrement form).
- `r0-indirect-counter` — uses R0 as a readable counter/switch for jump dispatch where provably safe.
- `indirect-memory-table` — builds a compact address table in memory and jumps by index.
- `indexed-packed-row-table` — stores packed rows/cells in an addressable table for dense display access.
- `coord-list-scaled-read` — reads coordinates via scaled index, removing runtime decode work.
- `coord-list-scaled-decimal-storage` — same as above but decimal form, using fewer cells.
- `fractional-indirect-addressing` — allows indirect access through fractional address arithmetic when proofs are available, including direct `bank[int(selector)]` memory selectors.
- `r0-fractional-sentinel` — uses a fractional-state sentinel in R0 to steer tables and to replace proved direct flow to 99 (`БП` or `F x?0`) with one-cell `К БП/К x?0 0` when the R0 mutation is dead.
- `super-dark-dispatch` — enables FA..FF range routing for shorter jumps with strictly valid address neighborhoods.

## 8) Spatial and coordinate-list optimization family

- `setup-coord-list-indirect-random-unique` — builds random-unique coordinate lists via indirect access to save layout.
- `coord-list-line-count-formatted-report-fusion` — merges line-count report construction with subsequent output.
- `coord-list-line-count-formatted-report-body` — extracts a shared report body for reuse.

- `spatial-sum-loop-helper` — extracts a shared summation loop if it appears in multiple sites.
- `spatial-sum-loop-helper-call` — turns repeated complex sum loops into one shared call.
- `spatial-hit-bit-mask-helper-reuse` — reuses a prepared bit-mask for hit helper paths.
- `spatial-neighbor-count-unroll` — unrolls small neighbor counting directly when it is shorter than a call.
- `bit-set-mask-cse` — removes repeated bit-mask calculations for identical coordinates.
- `single-bit-mask-op` — materializes a single-bit mask in scratch once, then applies `К ИНВ`, `К ∧`, or `К ∨` style operations.
- `bit-mask-helper` — emits shared helper routines that build bit masks from indices once per scratch register.
- `bit-mask-helper-call` — routes repeated `bit_mask` construction through existing helper labels instead of recompiling.
- `bit-mask-quotient-reuse` — reuses previously computed quotients/parts for mask generation.
- `grid-cell-mask-cse` — removes repeated 4x4 packed grid cell-mask calculations for adjacent membership/set operations.
- `indexed-packed-pow10-delta` — updates a dynamically indexed packed digit bank by a `pow10(...)` term without recompiling the whole self-update expression.

## 9) Display lowering strategy (largest semantic-sensitive area)

Display rewrites are separated into strategy selection + body lowering.

- `display-strategy-selection` — chooses the best output mode: packed, display-byte, literal splice, or shared helper.
- `display-expression-materialization` — prepares expressions for the display node so they can be compacted faster.
- `display-expression-materialization helper family` — adds temporary helper nodes only when there is a gain.
- `screen-text-lowering` — turns ordinary text blocks into minimal MK-61 instruction sequences.
- `screen-text-literal-first-splice` — optimizes the first segment of a text literal separately.
- `screen-text-literal-preload` — preloads a literal early so it is not treated as a runtime-computed path.
- `screen-decimal-literal-lowering` — prints decimal literals using a dedicated short scheme.
- `screen-leading-zero-hex-lowering` — removes extra leading zeros in hexadecimal output.
- `screen-sign-digit-literal-lowering` — prints sign + digit through a compact form.
- `screen-zero-digit-tail-lowering` — efficiently processes trailing zero digits in numeric strings.
- `screen-error-literal-lowering` — emits common errors/codes through a short output path.
- `screen-video-literal-helper` — lifts video/text literals into a reusable helper for repeated use.
- `screen-video-literal-helper-call` — calls `screen-video-literal-helper` instead of re-expanding the template.
- `packed-display-storage-reuse` — reuses already-packed storage for display output.
- `packed-display-helper` — extracts repeated packed display format into one helper.
- `packed-display-helper-call` — replaces repeated code with a call to that helper.
- `packed-display-lowering` — base path for packed numeric rendering.
- `display-byte-x2-lowering` — uses X2 extension for simplified byte-packet output.
- `display-byte-mask-lowering` — applies masking for byte-template output.
- `display-byte-variable-mask-lowering` — supports variable masks to avoid unnecessary branches.
- `display-byte-helper` — prepares a shared helper for frequent `display-byte` patterns.
- `display-byte-helper-call` — calls `display-byte-helper` when available.
- `floor-packed-row-display` — merges `floor` + packed-row into one short path.
- `floor-packed-row-expression-display` — same for expressions where floor comes from an expression.
- `formatted-coord-report-lowering` — compact output for formatted-coordinate reports. The recognizer now captures any `<literal> cell:width <literal> bearing:width` report shape and gates it on a verified layout descriptor (`VERIFIED_COORD_REPORT_FORMATS`): the video mask, the cell-scale exponent, and the video-anchor exponent are all read from that descriptor instead of scattered constants. The mask and exponents are hardware-fitted to the exact separators and field widths, so only on-hardware-verified layouts (currently the `--CC--N` screen: prefix `--`, cell width 2, separator `--`, bearing width 1, mask `8,-00--_`) lower through the video path; any other shape falls back to the generic per-item display lowering. Adding a new report layout is a data-only entry once its mask is verified.
- `formatted-coord-report-packed-body` — compresses report body into packed format.
- `display-decimal-literal-field` — prints a single integer field in decimal mode without extra parsing.
- `display-literal-first-digit-reuse` — reuses the first digit already printed in the template.
- `display-literal-minus-source-reuse` — reuses the source for minus/sign output.
- `display-current-x-reuse` — uses current X as display source and avoids extra transfers.
- `display-stack-reuse` — reuses terminal X stack usage in display and removes redundant jumps.
- `show-sequence-helper` — shared helper for typical `show(...)` sequences.
- `show-sequence-helper-call` — calls the shared helper instead of duplicating show blocks.
- `decimal-point-display` — renders fixed-point decimal layouts like `show(x, ".", frac)` by building fractional digits and dividing by 10^width.
- `display-byte` strategies (`display-byte-*`) are applied only with `display-bytes` flag; otherwise a safe fallback is used.

## 10) Random and numeric helpers

- `random-range-lowering` — shortens random value generation within a range into shorter microcode.
- `int-random-range-lowering` — returns only integer result without extra fractional post-processing.
- `prior-random-stack-reuse` — when source keeps a previous seed, updates the same seed with `random()`, and consumes both previous and current values in a pure expression, keeps the previous value on the stack instead of storing and recalling it.
- `random-cell-helper` — extracts shared random-cell handling into one helper.
- `random-cell-helper-call` — calls the extracted helper instead of repeating logic.
- `coord-list-scaled-read` — in random coordinate paths, reduces table-unfold cost.
- `remainder-fraction-lowering` — chooses quick modulo paths through fraction operations.

## 11) Arithmetic and operator normalization

- `small-set-primitive-lowering` — replaces small multi-way boolean/state sets with dense arithmetic chains.
- `packed-grid-primitive-lowering` — maps packed grid and digit helper operations into bit masks and add/sub-style forms. The square-board helpers are width-parametric: the coordinate wrap (`grid_norm` / `positiveGridNorm`, i.e. `% width`) and the right-diagonal fold (`+ width`) derive exactly from the board width and default to the shipped 4-wide grid. The fractional cell-mask packing constant (`10^x + floor(10^(y * K_width))`) is hardware-fitted per width — its digits encode each row's collision-free nibble offsets — so it lives in a verified width-keyed table (`cellMaskRowConstant`) with only the on-hardware-verified `width: 4` entry. Other widths derive their structural macros automatically but require a verified fractional constant before they can lower (`cell_mask` refuses to fabricate one), the same honest limit as the decimal-series emitter.
- `reciprocal-division-lowering` — lowers `1 / x`-form divisions into `F 1/x` after evaluating the right side once.
- `arithmetic-if-update` — turns conditional updates into arithmetic form instead of branching.
- `arithmetic-if-conditional-move` — replaces conditional `move`/copy with arithmetic form.
- `arithmetic-if-sign-toggle` — routes sign handling through arithmetic when it shortens branches.
- `arithmetic-if-abs` — converts absolute value to branchless arithmetic.
- `arithmetic-if-max` — computes max using a branchless path.
- `arithmetic-if-min` — computes min using a branchless path.
- `min-via-max-lowering` — rewrites source-level `min(a, b)` into a max-based normalized expression that uses the existing `К max` primitive path.
- `quirk-free-minmax-lowering` — rewrites source-level `safe_max(a, b)` and `safe_min(a, b)` into explicit arithmetic forms to avoid the MK-61 `К max` zero-is-greatest quirk:
  `safe_max = (a + b + abs(a - b)) / 2`, `safe_min = (a + b - abs(a - b)) / 2`.
  Requires both operands to be pure and duplicable.
- `pow-square-lowering` — rewrites `pow(x, 2)` into `F x^2`.
- `pow10-opcode-lowering` — rewrites `pow(10, n)` into `F 10^x`.
- `square-expression-lowering` — rewrites pure repeated multiplication `x * x` into `F x^2`.
- `arithmetic-if-double-clamp` — special double-check clamp in one arithmetic template.
- `arithmetic-if-comparison-mask` — builds comparison masks without explicit `if`.
- `arithmetic-if-boolean-algebra` — lowers complex boolean comparisons into masks and arithmetic.
- `hex-mantissa-arithmetic` — simplifies hex mantissa operations, lowering instruction count.
- `negative-zero-threshold-selector` — threshold check for `-0`/`0` when it reduces branches.
- `decimal-series-lowering` — emits a hand-tuned, hardware-verified decimal recurrence listing for a factorial-like `decimal_series` declaration. The parser now reads `digits` and `counterStart` from the source (no longer hardcoding `counterStart = 65`), and the emitter looks the pair up in a `VERIFIED_DECIMAL_SERIES_LISTINGS` table keyed by `(digits, counterStart)`. Each entry carries its full validated byte sequence — these recurrences are hand-tuned for the MK-61 and cannot be derived parametrically, so an unverified pair fails with a clear diagnostic that lists the verified pairs rather than fabricating bytes. The `(94, 65)` listing is currently the sole verified entry; adding another precision is a data-only table addition once its sequence is validated on hardware. **Note:** this is recognition/structure cleanup, not a true byte-level generalization — the recurrence bytes still come from a verified table, by design.

## 12) Register allocation and liveness-driven memory trims

- `interprocedural-value-propagation` — propagates known constants/values across function calls.
- `interprocedural-dead-store` — removes writes to cells not read beyond procedure boundaries.
- `elideXParamReturnStateFields` — removes unused X return-state fields and reduces memory.
- `elide`-style elimination patterns — remove intermediate bookkeeping artifacts when no longer needed.
- `constant-synthesis` — synthesizes reusable constants in minimally short ways. Exact positive powers of ten can be built as `exponent; F 10^x` when that beats digit entry, both in main code and setup preloads.
- `preloaded-constant` — preloads constants when cheaper than recomputing each time.
- `const-inline` — expands program-level `const` names at use sites before register allocation; literals then follow the usual `preloaded-constant` / inline digit cost model.
- `auto-preload-initial-state` — moves required startup cells into setup so main code is shorter.
- `preloaded-indirect-flow` — enables indexed writes via preloaded selector.
- `preincrement-indexed-store` — uses preincrement semantics for indexed stores where profitable.
- `register-coalesce` — coalesces cells when lifetimes do not overlap.
- `copy-coalesce` — removes redundant copy writes between registers.
- `last-x-reuse` — avoids `P->X` when X already holds the needed value.
- `known-zero-reuse` — reuses a known zero source instead of reloading.
- `inequality-zero-false-branch` — feeds `known-zero-reuse` after a false
  `!= 0` branch, avoiding a fresh zero literal or `Cx`.
- `zero-reuse` — similarly reuses zero in multiple places when liveness is confirmed.
- `stack-current-x-scheduling` — reorders current-X operations to avoid extra push/pop-like steps.
- `stack-resident-temps` — keeps up to four consecutive single-use temps on the stack, using `В↑` lifts and restore sequences (`X↔Y` / `F reverse`) before direct stack-based consumers.
- `stack-resident-indexed-temp` — keeps a single-use temp in X across one indexed compound store `cells[i] op= temp` when the temp is consumed exactly once and selector/index setup is not temp-dependent.
- `stack-resident-control-flow` — marks stack-temp fusion that crosses stack-preserving `if` / `while` / `dispatch` regions; these regions cannot clobber live temps and the lowering rebuilds stack state if the region requires it.
- `dead-temp-store` — removes temporary stores after their last read when no longer needed.
- `store-recall-peephole` — collapses `store` then immediate `recall` of same cell.
- `dead-store-elimination` — full pass removing pointless stores and empty branches.
- `repeated-assignment-value-reuse` — reuses the same computed value across multiple assignments, but yields to `initialized-counted-while-loop` when one of the repeated stores is the initializer for a following countdown loop. A one-cell literal reuse must not hide the much shorter `F Lx` loop shape.
- `int-frac-shared-tail` — a shared int/frac return tail reduces duplication.
- `z-stack-derived-value-reuse` — lowers Z-stack pressure by moving values through warm locations.

## 13) IR pass pipeline (fixed-point)

The IR pipeline defined in `src/core/passes/index.ts` runs repeatedly:

1. `redundant-prologue-elimination` — removes duplicate `display+HALT` prologues immediately before a jump target when an identical prologue is already at that jump target.
2. `tail-call-lowering` — rewrites certain tail `call`s and trailing `return`s into direct `БП`/tail flow when the continuation is the same for all exits of that region.
3. `tail-branch-inversion` — flips `cjump` condition when the then-path is only a single tail jump and the target label is uniquely referenced.
4. `shared-call-tail` — groups repeated `call` + `jump` tails (three or more occurrences), emits one shared helper tail, and replaces duplicates with `БП` to that helper.
5. `return-suffix-gadget` — finds repeated return-ending blocks ending in `return`, extracts one shared suffix, and redirects additional copies to it.
6. `shared-terminal-tail` — finds repeated straight-line suffixes that already end in unconditional flow (`БП`, `К БП r`, or `В/О`) and replaces extra copies with a jump into the canonical suffix; it refuses programs with absolute numeric flow targets.
7. `return-zero-jump` — when no procedure calls are used, replaces a backward jump to `01` with `В/О` and tags it as an empty-stack optimization.
8. `store-recall-peephole` — removes `X->П r` immediately followed by `П->X r` to the same register.
9. `jump-to-next-threading` — removes unconditional jumps where target is the next label in sequence.
10. `jump-thread` — threads labels by replacing jumps to label chains with the final target label.
11. `flow-x-reuse` — runs forward CFG data-flow for values already held in X and removes `П->X r` when every predecessor reaches that point with `r` still in X; it refuses absolute numeric and indirect flow targets.
12. `branch-target-x-reuse` — removes the first `П->X r` in a unique branch target when the source `cjump` tested the same recalled `r` and no fallthrough path can enter the target.
13. `stable-indirect-flow` — rewrites direct `jump/call/cjump` to indirect forms (`К БП`, `К ПП`, `К <cond>`) when a stable selector is already live in a register.
14. `preloaded-indirect-flow` — preloads a selector value into a spare stable register and rewrites repeated backward-direct numeric jumps/calls through that preloaded value; after rescue starts, subsequent proved shrinking rewrites are still accepted below the official window.
15. `indirect-memory-table` — rewrites direct `store/recall` into `К X->П`/`К П->X` when a stable selector maps to the indexed target cell.
16. `dead-store-before-commutative` — removes temporary stores that are followed by immediate `recall` + commutative ALU (`+` or `*`) and never read again before the next write of that register.
17. `dead-store-elimination` — removes stores whose target register is not live after the write and does not affect number-entry/input finalization.
18. `last-x-reuse` — removes `П->X r` when `X` already contains `r` from the immediately preceding `X->П`.
19. `r0-fractional-sentinel` — drops redundant immediate `П->X 3`/`X->П 3`
    after fractional-R0 indirect access when `R0` liveness proves that the
    direct access only repeats the hardware-selected `R3`; it also removes
    later `X->П 0`/`П->X 0` repetitions when the same straight-line path has
    already left the hardware `-99999999` sentinel in `R0` and `X` is proved to
    hold the same value, and rewrites direct `БП 99` / `F x?0 99` flow to
    `К БП 0` / `К x?0 0` when `R0` is already proved fractional and the
    resulting sentinel write is dead.
20. `vp-splice` — deletes redundant exponent-entry chains (`ВП ВП`) and inert `КНОП ВП` forms, reporting `vp-exponent-splice` when one or more cells are removed.
21. `vp-exponent-splice` — optimization marker emitted to `report.optimizations` when at least one `ВП`/`КНОП` redundancy optimization pass removes cells.
22. `vp-x2-peephole` — removes redundant `К {x}` that immediately follows a display-aware `ВП`/X2 marker and reports `vp-fraction-restore` when one or more restores are removed.
23. `constant-folding` — deletes identity arithmetic operations (`0+` and `1*`) when both operations are explicit user-facing constants.
24. `duplicate-failure-tail-merge` — removes duplicated `(label -> 0 -> pause)` failure tails by redirecting the first tail to the second.
25. `cse-display-block` — detects identical `recall/plain/.../return(stop)` blocks and replaces duplicates with one canonical block plus jump.
26. `dead-code-after-halt` — removes unreachable IR ops by CFG reachability from entry.
27. `register-coalesce` — merges non-overlapping register live ranges and, when enabled, performs copy coalescing for safe `recall/store` aliases.
28. `arithmetic-if-pass` — merges two branch paths that lower to byte-identical pure linear blocks (same side effects and same single-pass behavior).

A fixed-point loop repeats while transformations continue, up to internal iteration limits.

## 14) Setup-program and preload strategy

Setup generation is separate from main program layout when needed:

- `generated-setup-program` indicates that a setup routine was emitted.
- `preloaded-constant` and `constant-synthesis` entries describe synthetic constants.
- `duplicate-preload-store-reuse` — setup preload planning computed one numeric literal once and emitted `X->П` into multiple registers when values were identical in the same preload action.
- `intent-state-lowering` — moves declared state initialization into generated setup by emitting setup `store` operations and records that state-related initialization was lowered out of the main path.
- `auto-preload-initial-state` and `intent-state-lowering` can push selected state to setup only.
- `raw-block-contract` — records and applies the input/output/clobber/preserve contract for raw `core` blocks in helper emission.
- `intent-read-lowering`, `show-read-*` may force setup when runtime behavior or literals require state initialization.
- Setup helpers are themselves subject to the same optimization pipeline (`setup-...` names appear as prefixed entries).
- `indexed-bank-loop` — initializes runs of consecutively allocated indexed bank fields with one compact setup loop when their initializers and register layout allow it.

## 15) Machine features this optimizer may activate in report

Feature flags are added only after successful candidate/optimization evidence:

- `return-empty-stack-jump` — added when `return-zero-jump` is used; means the compiler selected `В/О` as the one-cell `БП 01` shape.
- `branch-removal` — added when `branch-removal` optimization rewrites a branch to a branchless equivalent.
- `indirect-flow` — added when register-held or preloaded indirect flow rewrites (`stable-indirect-flow`, `preloaded-indirect-flow`, `preloaded-super-dark-flow`) are emitted.
- `indirect-memory` — added when indirect-memory selectors are used (`indirect-memory-table`, `indexed-packed-row-table`).
- `dark-entries` — added from cyclic formal dark-entry selection and related layout features.
- `address-constants` — added when constants are reused as arithmetic/address-like data.
- `x2-register` — added when X2/Xп/дисплей-byte scheduling relies on X2 boundaries across display-byte paths.
- `negative-zero-degree` — added when `negative-zero-threshold-selector` proof uses the `1|-00` preload trick.
- `x2-restore-boundaries` — added when `vp-fraction-restore` is active.
- `z-stack-register` — added when `z-stack-derived-value-reuse` uses deeper stack-derived storage.
- `stack-resident-temps` — added when any stack-temporary residency optimization is used (`stack-resident-temps`, `stack-resident-indexed-temp`, or `stack-resident-control-flow`).
- `display-bytes` — added when display-byte or packed hex-mantissa lowering is active.
- `r0-fractional-sentinel` — added when fractional indirect addressing or R0 fractional sentinel flow/path is active.
- `r0-t-alias` — added when `r0-indirect-counter` path is selected and R0-transforming aliases are proven safe.
- `error-stops` — added for domain-error stop/trap lowering (`error-stop`, `screen-error-literal-lowering`, `domain-error-guard`).
- `code-data-overlay` — added when layout marks address cells as overlayable with code/data reuse.
- `super-dark-dispatch` — added when `super-dark-dispatch` or `preloaded-super-dark-flow` candidate is selected and FA..FF routing is proven.

These are not independent optimizations; they gate whether the lowering strategy can legally use the corresponding opcode/behavior.

## 16) Proof-guided safety model (important)

The optimizer does not blindly apply undocumented behavior. Several proofs are explicitly logged and checked:

- `value-ranges`, `observability`, and `formal-address-operands` when source bounds are known.
- `branch-equivalence` — records that conditional rewriting (`branch-removal` and arithmetic-if-family rewrites) was proven equivalent for the rewritten branch shapes.
- `negative-zero-threshold-selector` proof for threshold selectors.
- `indirect-addressing-ranges` proof when selector stability is required.
- `display-byte-observable-boundary` proof for display-byte candidates when only display-observable boundaries allow the optimization.
- `super-dark-suffix-layout` proof when FA..FF dispatch is selected.
- `return-stack-empty` proof for `I/O` as `JP 01` behavior.

If proofs are insufficient, those transformations are not activated.

## 17) Practical tuning rules for game authors

1. Prefer stable finite ranges for counters and coordinates.
2. Keep branch conditions simple and deterministic.
3. Compose displays from a few reusable fields.
4. Reuse identifiers in temporary values; this helps current-X reuse.
5. Avoid unnecessary string temporaries; prefer direct `show(...)` fragments.
6. Keep helper-like repeated computations in one place to trigger CSE and helper lowering.
7. Use single-purpose states and avoid side-effecting function wrappers unless semantically necessary.

## 18) What to inspect first after a compile

1. `report.budgetReport` for fit and largest blocks.
2. `report.optimizer` to see which capabilities were `active` / `considered` / `planned`.
3. `report.optimizations` for concrete names.
4. `machineFeaturesUsed` to ensure edge tactics were only enabled where intended.
5. `proofs` to validate any risky-looking branchless and indirect behavior.

## 19) Non-goals and current limits

- The compiler does not expose every microcode trick as a source hint.
- Some capability entries remain `candidate`/`planned` while not yet stable enough for global enabling.
- Optimization priority is always bounded by semantic safety and layout validity, then by cell budget.

This reference should be used as a working map while reading generated listings in explain/json mode: every named optimization corresponds to a concrete rewrite class that can be correlated with local sequences in emitted IR or final machine text.
